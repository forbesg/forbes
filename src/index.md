## Welcome to Forbes' slice of the web...

I am a freelance Website Developer from beautiful, and sometimes sunny Edinburgh.

I build small, fast and maintainable business websites for the good folk of Scotland and beyond, as well as
developing more complex web and mobile applications in my spare time.

You can view some of my previous projects and playthings on the Portfolio page.

If you would like to hire me to develop a website for you of you just have an enquiry
please do get in touch.
