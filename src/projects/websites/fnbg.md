This is a website for my Business, <a href="http://fnbg.co.uk" target="_blank">FNBG Business Cost Consultants</a>, and was what
led me to my interest in web development.

As part of starting the business there are all sorts of things that you need to
get set-up, and one of the most important, I felt, was a website.

My business site started its life as a Google Site which, as anyone who has used
the service will know, has severe limitations. The frustrations grew as the site,
although functional, was far from easy on the eye. In addition to this, at a time
when mobile and tablet browser use were on the rise, the site was a calamity.

I started to learn *HTML* and *CSS* and proceeded to create my first static site.

Over the last couple of years I have implemented *Twitter Bootstrap*, some *PHP*
includes for ease of management / maintenance, as well as a little *AJAX* for
requesting additional content while keeping the initial page size low and
requesting content from my (shamefully out-of-date) Blogger Site.
