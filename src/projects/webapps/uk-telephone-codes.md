The UK Telephone Codes App was a simple project to play around with the XMLHttpRequest.

Bootstrap CSS was used for the basic styles with a few additional lines of CSS added to
override the default Bootstrap styles.

The data is stored in JSON format and requests are sent using AJAX and the necessary
information rendered in the view.

Both AJAX request, data handling and page re-rendering are handled from a single
script file of 6KB.
