The Recipe Manager Application is built entirely in JavaScript using the MEAN Stack and allows users to
build up a database of their favorite recipes as well and view and rate other
users recipes.

The application uses MongoDB to store users data and manage query requests.

The back-end uses Express.js to provide the Web Server and API both of which are
running in a Node.js environment.

The front-end client side code uses Angular JS to manipulate and render the data
retrieved from the API.

Responsive layout is achieved using YETI Bootstrap and UI animations use Angulars
ng-animate and CSS3.
