## My Journey So Far

I have a background in sales spending 10 years in the telecoms industry. As my
skills grew I started up my own company supplying telecoms to business.

As part of any new start-up business, spending money was not something I wanted to do too much
of and yet I knew the importance of having an online presence.

I decided to try and create my own website using "user friendly" free tools that were available
at the time. My emails were being hosted by Google Apps so I started off with Google Sites as a
simple solution. Although creating a presence online I was frustrated by the contraints
of building using a tool like Google Sites (and I wanted rounded corners).

I had never written any HTML or CSS at this stage but felt that it couldn't be
hard to create the simple site that I was looking for. I started teaching myself
HTML and CSS and very quickly was able to create a website that I was far more
satisfied with, but more importantly I really enjoyed doing it.

I continued to learn and optimise my companies site.
