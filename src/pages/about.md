## My Journey So Far

My interest in Web Development started fairly late. I have a background in sales
spanning 10 years in the telecoms industry. As my
skills grew I started up my own company supplying <a href="https://www.fnbg.co.uk" target="_blank">telecoms to business</a>.

As part of any new start-up business, spending money was not something I wanted to do too much
of and yet I knew the importance of having an online presence.

I decided to try and create my own website using "user friendly" free tools that were available
at the time. My emails were being hosted by Google Apps so I started off with Google Sites as a
simple solution. Although creating a presence online I was frustrated by the constraints
of building using a tool like Google Sites (and I wanted rounded corners).

I had never written any HTML or CSS at this stage but felt that it couldn't be
hard to create the simple site that I was looking for. I started teaching myself
HTML and CSS and very quickly was able to create a website that I was far more
satisfied with, but more importantly I really enjoyed doing it.

I continued to learn and optimise my companies site. In order to make the site more
maintainable and interactive I started to learn a little PHP and got a firmer grasp
of JavaScript.

I began some other web projects using the evermore popular Content Management
Systems such as Joomla, Wordpress and MODX. With this came my introduction to
databases and MySQL.

With on growth of JavaScript and NodeJS, web applications were becoming evermore
capable and I found my new test. JavaScript became my focus.

BlackBerry have always had a place in my heart so I used their platform to hone
my skills. Creating simple Webworks/Cordova applications gave me small projects
to to discover the capabilities and pitfalls of JavaScript.

At the same time I was discovering more about running JavaScript on the server
with NodeJS and interacting with NoSQL Databases such as MongoDB and CouchDB. I created
a couple of applications using the MEAN Stack using Angular for the front-end.

Some of my work is shown on the [Portfolio Page](/portfolio)

My journey continues...
